It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data - all of which can be vital to both npm and to the end users of the package. The package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.
package.json is a versioning file that primarily contains the list of dependencies (libraries) your node.js project needs to run.

It also includes other meta information like scripts, author & license information, description, project properties etc.
